# Space Rocket App

[![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/Unity-2022.3.9f1-informational)](/README.md)

## Description

This Unity application was developed as part of a Master's thesis within the Interaction Systems Group [(REACT)](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/react/) at EPFL.

The aim of this application is to offer digital support enabling teachers to build interactive and customizable course scenarios. 

The application covers the basics of Newton's laws. In concrete terms, a space rocket is simulated and users can play with the rocket's initial velocity and thrust force.
